Personalizing Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for meeting individual user needs on mobile devices. However, on-device personalization faces challenges from limited computational resources and scarce personal data. We propose XPerT, a technique that fine-tunes an already personalized LLM using user data and selects models based on explainability of prior fine-tuning.
